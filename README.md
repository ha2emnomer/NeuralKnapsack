# NeuralKnapsack

This the offical implementation of Neural Knaspack Solver. 
The solver is based on Memory Networks and Seq2Seq models. 
You can run experiments by running: 
```python 
python main.py
```
Add your experiments configuration in configs/Config
You can also visualize solver solutions and statistics.
